# Alex's dotfiles

Looking for my [home server](/files/docker/home-server/) docker setup?

To install starship, setup bashrc, gitconfig and optionally i3, run the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/alexthemaster/dotfiles && cd dotfiles && chmod +x ./setup && ./setup` (bash only - works on windows and linux)
